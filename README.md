# Onboarding Buddy: AI-powered assistant for new hires

A lightweight onboarding assistant that gives new hires a clear checklist and answers policy/benefits FAQs. Built as a PM-focused, low-code prototype: Lovable for the UI and n8n for workflow/LLM logic.

## TL;DR
- **Problem**  
  The first week at a new job is overwhelming for employees and repetitive for HR.  
  New hires juggle multiple setup tasks and policies, while HR spends hours answering FAQs.  

- **Solution**  
  A simple onboarding assistant with:  
  1. **Checklist** ‚Äì clear, step-by-step tasks for new hires  
  2. **AI chatbot** ‚Äì instant answers to policy & benefits FAQs  

- **My Role**  
  Defined the problem, wrote the PRD, designed wireframes in Figma, built the prototype in Lovable,  
  and automated workflows in n8n with OpenAI.

## üöÄ Core features
1) **Onboarding checklist**  
   - 3‚Äì4 essential setup tasks with short descriptions and direct links.

2) **AI chat assistant**  
   - Answers common HR/benefits/policy questions from a curated knowledge base.  
   - Guardrails:
     - If HR-related but unknown ‚Üí hands off to HR email.
     - If not HR-related ‚Üí politely declines.


## üë©‚Äçüíª Who it‚Äôs for
- **Primary:** New hires in week 1.
- **Secondary:** HR teams looking to reduce repetitive questions.


## üå± Outcomes I‚Äôm targeting
- ‚â• 90% checklist completion in week 1  
- ‚â• 80% FAQ resolution without HR escalation  
- Avg. first-week satisfaction ‚â• 4/5  
- Lower ‚Äútime to productivity‚Äù on required setup tasks


## üõ†Ô∏è How it works (architecture)
- **Frontend:** Lovable (no-code UI)  
- **Workflow/logic:** n8n  
- **LLM:** OpenAI Chat Model  
- **Knowledge base:** Notion (mock knowledge base for POC)

**High level flow**
1. UI sends question ‚Üí **n8n Webhook**
2. **n8n AI Agent**:
   - Uses OpenAI for response
   - Pulls policy/benefits info from Notion
   - Keeps short-term context (‚Äúmemory‚Äù)
3. **Format response** ‚Üí return to UI

> Note: In production, the knowledge base would point to the company‚Äôs sources (HRIS, policy hub, benefits portal). No live company data is used here.

> Tip: Add a short GIF of the chat flow (`chat-demo.gif`) to make the repo skimmable.


## üîß Run notes (for reviewers)
- Lovable UI is live via the link above.  
- The chatbot endpoint was run locally via n8n for the demo.  
- If you want to import the workflow, use the JSON in `/workflow/` and set:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (n8n credentials)
  - Notion credentials & DB IDs (for the mock KB)
